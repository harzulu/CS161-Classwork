PART 4:

A: I noticed the test cases within the functions, such as asking what letters to swap.

B: All of them give me Segmentation Fault 11

C: I didn't get anything.

D: I just took away the delete[]

E: I kept getting Segmentation Fault 11..... I think it has something to do with pointers.

PART 5:

Implemented all

I got my girlfriend to test it.
It all just gave Segmentation Fault...

I need to work on pointers and dynamic memory so I don't get Segmentation Fault.
